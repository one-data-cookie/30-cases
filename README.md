# 30 Cases â€“ Puzzle Hunt ðŸŽ‰

A small treasure hunt website with 30 puzzles. It was made for my wife's
30th birthday but can be used quite broadly.

## Features

- Inspired by [30 pÅ™Ã­padÅ¯ majora Zemana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Cases_of_Major_Zeman)
- 30 puzzles, each with a lock and a random filename (to avoid skipping ahead)
- Answers are checked via SHA-256 hashes (not stored in plain text)
- Bonus rounds every 5th puzzle (to give out presents/prizes)
- Hints system, images, responsive design, ...
- Texts in Czech but can be easily switched to English

## Customisation

- Come up with puzzles and generate answer hashes using `utils/answers-hashing.js`
- Edit puzzles, (hashed) answers, hints, and bonuses in `public/puzzles.json`
- Change index/intro/outro in `index.html`, `welcome.html`, and `goodbye.html`
- Adjust styles in `src/style.css` and favicon in `public/favicon.ico`
- Translate UI and puzzle texts if needed (currently Czech)

## Deployment

- Build:  
  ```
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
- Deploy the `dist/` folder to Netlify or any static host

## Notes

- Uses Vite, `js-sha256`, and `canvas-confetti`
- Has puzzles in `puzzles/`, logic in `src/`, data in `public/`
